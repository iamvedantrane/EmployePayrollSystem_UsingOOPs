# EmployePayrollSystem_UsingOOPs
🚀 About the Project EmployeePayrollSystem_UsingOOPs is a console-based Java application designed to manage employee salary details using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to build a modular and scalable payroll management system.  🧩 Key Features Add new employee records  View all employee payroll details  Update employee information (e.g., salary, department)  Delete employee records  Calculate monthly salary and generate payroll summaries  Console-based menu-driven interface  💻 Technologies Used Java (Core)  OOP Concepts (Classes, Inheritance, Interfaces, etc.)  Collections Framework (e.g., ArrayList)  Console I/O  📚 Learning Objectives Understand and apply OOP principles in Java  Implement modular code architecture  Practice Java collections and file handling (if applicable)  Build a functional console-based application  📦 Project Structure graphql Copy Edit ├── Employee.java             # Base class for employee attributes ├── PayrollService.java       # Handles logic for salary and operations ├── EmployeeManager.java      # CRUD operations for employees ├── EmployeePayrollSystem.java # Main application class with menu └── README.md 🛠 How to Run Clone the repository  Compile the code using javac  Run the EmployeePayrollSystem class  Interact via the console menu  🤝 Contributions Open to contributions! You can fork this repo, improve the system (e.g., by adding file storage or GUI), and submit a pull request.
